    "First, we try to see how many pitches the catcher is involved in. That way, we can determine how long he has been in the league, or how experienced he is. From both test and train datasets, we can determine that the catcher catches `10998` different pitches. If we assume that the data records every single pitch in the game, we can calculate how many games he has played. Let's assume he played each game completely (all innings without being subbed out), then \n",
