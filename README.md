### Where things are:
The response to all the questions are given **IPython Notebook**. 

The first coding challenge (_isStrike prediction_) is in [strike_analysis.ipynb](./strike_analysis.ipynb) and the code is in [strike.py](./strike.py).

The second coding challenge (_catcher analysis_) is in [catcher_analysis.ipynb](./catcher_analysis.ipynb) and the code is in [catcher.py](./catcher.py).

The responses to short questions are in [written_responses.ipynb](./written_responses.ipynb).

Note that the data files from the [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U4qdIxuBplBEtzE6vicG6K0zTP8IlRsO) should be first downloaded to [data folder](./data/) folder before running the code files.
